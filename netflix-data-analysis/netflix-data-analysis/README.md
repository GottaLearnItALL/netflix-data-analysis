Analyzing Netflix Content trends using Python, Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib

I have used the data analysis libraries provided by python(pandas,numpy and matplotlib)
to perform Data Analysis on the Netflix DataSet form Kaggle, to answer the following questions!

* What are the Top most common Ratings ?
* Netflix titles released by Decades ?
* How much percentage of Titles are Movies or Tv Shows ?
* Which Countries produce the most Titles ?


The findings were straight forward and easy to understand. I found out that The most common rating on 
netflix is TV-MA rating about 3000 titles have it furthermore the decade that released the most titles was surprisingly
2010's. And about 69% of titles on netflix are Movies according to the pie chart. In conclusion this was a fun
exercise to perform data analysis on major streaming platform to gain insight on its data.
